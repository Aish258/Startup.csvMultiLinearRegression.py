🚀 Multiple Linear Regression on Startup Dataset
This project demonstrates the application of Multiple Linear Regression using a Startup dataset. The goal is to predict the Profit of startups based on various independent variables like R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file typically named 3_Startups.csv, which contains the following columns:

R&D Spend

Administration

Marketing Spend

State (Categorical)

Profit (Target Variable)

📌 Objective
To build a regression model that can accurately predict a startup’s profit based on its expenditures and state.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-learn (for modeling)

📊 Steps Involved
Data Loading

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
